I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Apple/AIML, where I primarily focus on query resolution for Apple Siri, including suggestion and recommendation. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Columbia University, working with Prof. [Zhou Yu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/). I was also a member of the [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Group](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/people.cgi). My research mainly focused on natural language generation and conversational AI. Particularly, I was interested in building task-oriented dialogue systems with limited resources. Prior to Columbia University, I received my B.S. in Physics from Nanjing University and M.S. in Electrial and Computer Engineering from Johns Hopkins University, working with Prof. [Sanjeev Khudanpur](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev/) and Prof. [Daniel Povey](https://www.danielpovey.com/).
